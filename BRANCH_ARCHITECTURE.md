# ChainLink Game - Branch Architecture Strategy

## 🎯 **Core Principle**
**Main branch must ALWAYS be stable and runnable without depending on feature branch code.**

## 🏗️ **Branch Structure**

### **Main Branch (`main`)**
- ✅ **Core ChainLink gameplay** - Fully functional
- ✅ **Correct bridge validation** - 2+ shared letters rule
- ✅ **Production-ready** - Can be deployed anytime
- ✅ **No feature dependencies** - Self-contained
- ✅ **Stable baseline** - Other branches merge into this

### **Feature Branches**
Each feature branch is **independent** and contains:

#### **`feature/leaderboards`**
- Game Center integration
- Leaderboard services
- Social features
- **Status**: Ready to merge

#### **`feature/daily-challenges`**
- Daily challenge system
- Progress tracking
- Challenge UI components
- **Status**: Ready to merge

#### **`feature/game-modes`**
- 5 game modes (Blitz, Zen, Survival, Tournament, Practice)
- Mode-specific logic and UI
- **Status**: Ready to merge

#### **`feature/monetization`**
- Store, IAP, Lightning Pass
- Ad integration
- **Status**: Ready to merge

#### **`feature/achievements`**
- Achievement system
- Reward distribution
- Notifications
- **Status**: Ready to merge

#### **`feature/integration-testing`**
- Analytics, monitoring
- Feature flags
- Performance tracking
- **Status**: Ready to merge

## 🔄 **Integration Workflow**

### **Phase 1: Core Game (Current - Main Branch)**
```bash
# Main branch contains:
- Core ChainLink gameplay ✅
- Bridge word validation (2+ letters) ✅
- Game flow (start → game → game over) ✅
- Rules and UI ✅
- Production ready ✅
```

### **Phase 2: Feature Integration (When Ready)**
```bash
# For each feature branch:
git checkout main
git merge feature/leaderboards
# Test thoroughly
git push origin main

git checkout main  
git merge feature/daily-challenges
# Test thoroughly
git push origin main

# Continue for each feature...
```

### **Phase 3: Complete Integration**
```bash
# After all features merged:
- All features work together ✅
- Full ChainLink experience ✅
- Production deployment ready ✅
```

---

## 🛡️ **Safety Rules**

### **Main Branch Protection**
1. **Never import from feature branches**
2. **Always test before merging**
3. **Keep core game stable**
4. **Feature flags for gradual rollout**

### **Feature Branch Development**
1. **Branch from main**
2. **Develop independently**
3. **Test thoroughly**
4. **Merge back when complete**

---

## 🎮 **Current Status**

### **Main Branch** ✅
- Core game works perfectly
- Correct bridge validation rules
- Ready for feature integration
- No dependencies on feature branches

### **Feature Branches** ✅
- All features complete and tested
- Ready to merge when needed
- Independent and self-contained
- Can be integrated one by one

---

## 🚀 **Next Steps**

### **Option 1: Gradual Integration**
```bash
# Merge features one at a time
git checkout main
git merge feature/leaderboards
# Test and deploy
# Then next feature...
```

### **Option 2: Complete Integration**
```bash
# Merge all features at once
git checkout main
git merge feature/leaderboards
git merge feature/daily-challenges  
git merge feature/game-modes
git merge feature/monetization
git merge feature/achievements
git merge feature/integration-testing
# Test everything together
```

### **Option 3: Feature Flags**
```bash
# Merge all features with feature flags
# Gradually enable features for users
# A/B test different combinations
```

---

## 📋 **Testing Strategy**

### **Before Each Merge**
- [ ] Feature branch works independently
- [ ] No breaking changes to core game
- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] Manual testing complete

### **After Each Merge**
- [ ] Core game still works
- [ ] New features work
- [ ] No conflicts with existing features
- [ ] Performance acceptable

---

## 🎯 **Summary**

**The main branch should NOT call other branches directly.** Instead:

1. **Main branch** = Stable core game
2. **Feature branches** = Independent development
3. **Integration** = Merge features into main when ready
4. **Testing** = Verify everything works together
5. **Deployment** = Main branch becomes production

This ensures the main branch is always stable and deployable! 🚀
